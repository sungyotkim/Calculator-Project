# Calculator-Project
Creating a calculator using html/css/js. Basic calculator functionality inspired by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j59qQ7YWLxw&ab_channel=WebDevSimplified) and calculator design inspired by [Ranjan-Beginner's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jAEyP9a1hg&ab_channel=Ranjan-Beginner%27sGuide). In order to challenge myself and incorporate what I've learned, I took it a few steps further to incorporate more functionality beyond the basic 4 calculator functions.
